== Screenshots ==

1. In the example above, you will notice a CTA shortcode driving interest to a free trial registration as well as two CTA widgets at the bottom of the page - one driving to a webinar and the other to download an eBook.

2. In the example above, you will notice that we’ve double-exposed our eBook CTA widget, this time on a product page in hopes of boosting conversions rather than leaving the widget on the home page only.

Each page should have a CTA of some sort looking to drive interest to a web form whereby you convert your visitors into known leads.

3. In the example above you will notice the web form that pertains to our eBook download. In using WordPress you can easily create pages such as these that act as landing pages to convert after a CTA drives your visitors to them.

Tips: When creating a page like this to convert visitors into known leads, make sure that your text is direct and brief; focus on what your visitors will get by filling in the web form. Finally, make sure that the colors you use when designing your web form attract the eye in hopes of boosting your conversion rates.

4. In the example above you will notice a simple, single-field form used to generate blog subscription registrations. Sometimes less truly is more when it comes to the amount of fields used within your web form.
